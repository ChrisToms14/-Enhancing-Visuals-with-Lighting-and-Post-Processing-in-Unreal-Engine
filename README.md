# -Enhancing-Visuals-with-Lighting-and-Post-Processing-in-Unreal-Engine

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and practicing the **lighting** and **post-processing systems** in Unreal Engine. As a beginner, the goal of this study is to learn how different lighting techniques and visual effects work together to improve the overall look, mood, and realism of a scene.

## Step 1: Lighting Study

In this step, I explored the basic lighting system in Unreal Engine to understand how light affects a scene.

I experimented with **light intensity** to see how brightness changes the visibility and mood of objects. Different **light colors and temperatures** were tested to observe how warm and cool tones influence the atmosphere. I also worked with **directional lights** to simulate sunlight and studied how shadows behave when the light angle is changed. To add depth, I used **point lights and spotlights** for focused lighting in specific areas. A **skylight** was used to balance the overall lighting and reduce overly dark regions.

This step helped me understand how lighting forms the base of a realistic environment.

## Step 2: Post-Processing Study

After setting up the lighting, I studied the **post-processing system** to enhance the final visual output.

Using a **Post-Process Volume**, I experimented with **Bloom** to softly highlight bright areas, making light sources feel more natural. I applied **Depth of Field** to learn how focus and blur can guide the viewer’s attention. **Ambient Occlusion** was tested to improve depth by adding subtle shadows in corners and contact areas. I also adjusted **Color Grading** settings such as contrast and saturation to give the scene a more consistent and pleasing look.

This step helped me understand how post-processing improves the scene after lighting is applied.

## Step 3: Scene Testing and Observation

In this step, I tested the scene to observe how lighting and post-processing work together.

I viewed the scene from different camera angles to check for lighting inconsistencies and visual issues. The scene was tested in **Play Mode** to see how the lighting behaves in real time. Based on observations, small adjustments were made to improve balance, clarity, and mood.

This step helped me learn the importance of testing and refining visual settings to achieve a clean and polished result.

## Learning Outcome
Through this study, I gained a basic understanding of Unreal Engine’s lighting and post-processing systems and how they contribute to creating visually appealing and realistic scenes.
