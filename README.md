# -Enhancing-Visuals-with-Lighting-and-Post-Processing-in-Unreal-Engine

# Overview

This project intends to learn and implement these concepts of **Lighting** and **Post-production systems** provided by Unreal Engine. As a beginner, one of the focal points of my research would be to understand how different light parameters and visual effects can be synchronized to improve the entire look and reality of a given environment.

## Step 1: Study on Lighting

To make

Here, I analyzed the basic lighting system available in Unreal Engine to understand the concept of light in a scene.

Lighting Intensity: I have also performed experiments on **light intensity**, examining the influence of light intensities on the visibility and mood generated by objects. Various **light colors and temperatures** have also been experimented on, examining the influence of warmer and cooler zones on moods. **Directional lighting** can also be used to generate lighting effects similar to the sun. The influence of variations in the direction of the directionally lit lighting on the generated shadows on the surfaces has also been considered. To add more realisms to the environment, **point lighting and spot lighting** can also be used. A **sky-light** can also be used to add balancing touch to the lighting effects.

This has made it possible for me to appreciate the role that lighting plays in establishing a basis for a believable environment.

## Step 2: Post-Processing Study

The lighting arrangement set by me was analyzed, and then the **post-processing system** was analyzed for further improvement of the output.

I used "Post-Process Volume" to test **Bloom**, which added a soft lighting effect to the highlighted regions, making it look natural. "Depth of Field" post-process was used to analyze the focus and blur techniques to guide the viewer’s attention to a specific point. "Ambient Occlusion" post-process was used to test the functionality that added darkness to the corners to increase the sense of depth. "Color Grading" had parameters such as contrast and saturation levels that needed to be optimized to obtain a balanced effect.

In this phase, I realized that post-processing aids in improving an environment by incorporating light.

## Step 3: Testing and observation of scenes of interest
In

“At this point, I was experimenting with testing the scene for lighting interactions with post-processing,” Benny explains.

I traversed through the scenario with varied views of the camera to analyze for inconsistencies in relation to lighting. Further, analysis of the Lighting Effect in **Play Mode** was done to evaluate how well the Lighting Effect works. Modifications were made based on the analysis. This phase taught me the importance of optimal graphical options for having a smooth and clean graphical environment. --- ## Learning Outcome Through this project, I have been able to gain fundamental knowledge about Unreal Engine Lighting and Post-Processing and how it can be used to create a Aesthetic scene.
